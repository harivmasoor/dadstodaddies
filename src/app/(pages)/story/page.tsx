        <p className="text-xl mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          As a new father, I found myself caught in the whirlwind of parenthood. <span className="font-bold text-red-600">Late-night feedings, endless diaper changes, and the constant worry about my child's well-being</span> left little time for self-care. Before I knew it, <span className="italic">the pounds had piled on, and my energy levels hit rock bottom</span>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          It's <span className="font-bold">frighteningly easy for fathers to let themselves go</span>. We often put our families first, neglecting our own health in the process. But I realized that by doing so, I wasn't just hurting myselfâ€”I was setting a poor example for my child.

          That's when I decided: <span className="font-bold text-green-600">today, we turn it around</span>. I created Dads To Daddies
          <Image src="/drool.png" alt="Drool" width={25} height={25} className="inline ml-1" />
          , a supportive community where fathers can come together to share experiences, motivate each other, and work towards healthier lifestyles.
